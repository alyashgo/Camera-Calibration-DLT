## About:
Camera calibration refers to the estimation of all eleven camera parameters, out of which five are intrinsic and six are extrinsic. The intrinsic parameters from the name itself are invariant to the position of the camera coordinate axis with respect to the world coordinate axis. However, this is not true for the extrinsic parameters which vary along the movement of the camera. In this repository, we make use of the world and image coordinates of 12 fiducial points marked on 3 checkboard planes placed orthogonal to each other. We make use of RQ decomposition to obtain the intrinsic parameter matrix and the rotation matrix.
